2. Practical PGP - Installation, Usage, Demo

3. Do it yourself!

# THEORETICAL PGP!

---

# The Problem

I want to send and receive email from Bob and make sure:

* No one else can read OR modify its contents

* I trust that Bob is Bob, and Bob trusts that I am me

???

Email is like a postcard -- anyone can see its contents in transit (or even modify the message), and you can put any "From" address on it you want

when you're talking to someone on the internet you don't know

* if the person you're talking is who they say they are (authentication)
* if someone (either your communication client or a 3rd party) is intercepting (either reading or manipulating) your messages (confidentiality, integrity)

---

# The Solution

Use **public key cryptography** to achieve **end-to-end encryption**

---

# Public Key Cryptography (tl;dr edition)

* Each person has a (private key, public key) pair

* Two basic sets of operations:
* Encrypt / Decrypt
      ```
      encrypt(plaintext, public key) -> ciphertext
      decrypt(ciphertext, private key) -> plaintext
      ```
* Sign / Verify
      ```
      sign(data, private key) -> signature
      verify(data, signature, public key) -> ok?
      ```

???

Encryption: usually for ensuring data confidentiality. usually means encrypting your data (a message) into cyphertext with the public key of the intended recipient.

actions: encrypt, decrypt

Signing: usually for verifying data integrity and authentication. usually means signing the hash (which is smaller) the of the data with your private key to create a signature. 

actions: sign, verify

Lockbox analogy: Public key encryption is like one of those locked ballot box / suggestion box things. Anyone can (with the public key) put something into a lockbox. Once something is in the lockbox, only the person with the (private) key can open the box to read what's inside. Don't think about the public key as a key, think about it as a lockbox.

---

# Trust Models

* How do you know that you can trust a key?

* Centralized (e.g. HTTPS)

    * Certificate Authority hierarchy

* Decentralized (e.g. PGP)

    * Web of Trust

???

Also cover: difference between trust and validity

---

# Finding and Trusting Keys

* **Public key certificate server**: databases of public keys of people (of unverified identities), so that you can send encrypted messages (signed with their public key) to them.

* **Your keyring**: list of public keys whose owners' identities are verified by you

* **Web of trust**: "web" of public keys whose owners' identities are verified, usually via in person contact (e.g. PGP key signing party)

---

# Using your Key

* Signing someone else's key to show that you trust that their key belongs to them (e.g. during a PGP key signing party)

* Signing your software release so that people can verify that you wrote it and that it hasn't been modified

* Signing your email and attaching the signature with it so that the receiver can verify that you wrote it and that it hasn't been modified

* Encrypting your email and sending the ciphertext so that no one else can tamper your message (often you'll also sign the email)

* Encrypting and signing your backups in Amazon S3 to make sure that Amazon can't mess with your data and can't read your secret files

---

# Limitations of PGP
### (aka, ways the NSA can still get you)
### (aka, why PGP is only "pretty good" privacy)

* Endpoint security

* Metadata (e.g., subject line)

* User error

* Scalability

???

endpoint security: if your computer (or your recipient's computer) has NSA malware on it then PGP won't stop them from reading your messages (or stealing your key).

metadata: Email headers are not encrypted: the NSA can see the subject line, the date you sent, who you sent it to, etc.

ease of use: All your recipients need to be using PGP, so it doesn't scale well to mailing lists

# PRACTICAL PGP!

---

# PGPGP

* OpenPGP - the standard https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880

* PGP - 1st implementation of OpenPGP standard, now commercial proprietary software owned by Symantec

* GPG - GNU Private Guard, open source implementation of the OpenPGP standard, the thing everyone uses

(But in reality, people use all three terms interchangeably)

---

# Installing PGP: Mac OS

* Graphical clients also available (https://gpgtools.org/)

* Or, for CLI client only, `brew install gpg2`

* EFF tutorial on installing https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-mac-os-x

* With Apple Mail: https://gpgtools.org/

---

# Installing PGP: Linux

* `apt install gnupg` (or "pacman -S gnupg", etc.)

* https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-linux

---

# Installing PGP: Windows

* `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

* https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-windows

* How to download GPG4Win + Thunderbird integration

* tested, once this is installed, the CLI client works (in `cmd.exe`)

---

# Basic Operations

* Create your key
    * `gpg --gen-key`

* Figure out your key fingerprint
    * `gpg --list-secret-keys --fingerprint`

* Upload key to keyserver
    * `gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-key <fingerprint or key id>`

???

We're going over command line way of doing it -- on Mac there is a GUI way of doing this that may be easier

If you already have a key, figure out if you know the passphrase for it. If not, maybe it's time to create a new key (and optionally delete the old one).

---

# Basic Operations (continued)

* Download a key from the keyservers
    * `gpg --recv-key <fingerprint or key id>`
* Sign a blob of text
    * `gpg --clearsign`
* Sign and encrypt a blob of text
    * `gpg --sign --encrypt --armor`
* Decrypt a blob of text
    * `gpg --decrypt`
* Verify a signature
    * `gpg --verify`

---

# Signing keys

* Verify the person's identity (e.g., with photo ID)
* Download their key from a keyserver:
    * `gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-key <their fingerprint or key id>`
* Sign the key
    * `gpg --sign-key`
* Check with the person that the fingerprint you see is correct before saying "yes"!
* Send their signed key to the keyserver
    * `gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-key <their fingerprint or key id>`

# Encrypt/decrypt your email

* Thunderbird: Install Enigmail
    * https://ssd.eff.org has tutorials for setting up for setting up Enigmail with Thunderbird

* Apple Mail
    * https://gpgtools.org/

* Gmail:
    * Write email in a text editor
    * Encrypt and sign the email
    * Paste it into gmail

---

# Other key maintenance stuff

* Backing up your key (`.gnupg` directory)

* Key expiration

* Revocation certificates (make one!)

* Key comments
